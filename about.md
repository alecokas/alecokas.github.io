<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am studying towards an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge. I'm fascinated by machine learning and a strong believer in data-driven solutions. Previously, I've studied electrical engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and worked as a Software Development Engineer at Peralex Electronics. I'm particularly interested in NLP and Speech Processing.
