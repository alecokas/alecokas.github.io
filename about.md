Currently, I work as a machine learning engineer at Ocado Technology in the 10x team. My responcibilities span the research, implementation, and early stage productionisation of machine learning models. I'm particularly interested in Graph Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition.

Previously, I completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge and studied electrical engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. In between these two academic persuits, I worked at Peralex Electronics as a Software Engineer looking into whether deep learning techhniques can be used to replace and improve traditional signal detection systems.

In my down-time I enjoy listening to podcasts (give [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/) a listen) and attempting to bake. If you want to find out more about my professional skills, take a look at my [Github profile](https://github.com/alecokas) and my [resume](/PDFs/resume/A-Kastanos-CV.pdf).
