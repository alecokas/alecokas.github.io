I am a machine learning engineer with research interests in Graph Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The process of coming up with novel solutions to difficult modelling problems and selecting the appropriate evaluation criteria in messy real-world contexts is a passion of mine. Some of my favourite tools include Python, PyTorch, NLTK, Docker, and Julia.

Currently, I work as a machine learning engineer at Deliveroo and am studying for an MA in philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London. At Deliveroo my projects focus on the robustness and tracibility of existing pricing models and developing new pricing strategies. Previously, I worked at Ocado Technology where my responsibilities spanned the research, implementation, and early-stage productionisation of machine learning models. I completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge and studied electrical engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. I briefly worked as a software engineer at Peralex Electronics where I investigated whether deep learning techniques can be used to replace and improve traditional signal detection systems.

My interest areas in philosophy centre around topics in the political, social, and ethical domains. I write on [responsible AI](https://www.whattodoaboutnow.com/post/responsible-ai-responsible-to-whom) and enjoy listening to podcasts (give [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/) a listen).
