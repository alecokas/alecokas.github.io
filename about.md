## Machine Learning and AI Governance

I have six years of experience working as a machine learning engineer across three companies. Coming up with novel solutions to difficult modelling problems is what I do. I really enjoy working in environments where evaluating the effectiveness of the machine learning intervention is core to the challenge. Early in my career my research interestes were in in Graph Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. More recently my focus has been in the price optimisation space. These projects tend to focus on ensuring robustness and tracibility of existing pricing models while developing new pricing strategies. In 2025 I took on a leadership role in AI Governance where I have been able to use technology to solve compliance challenges in a faced-paced environment.

## Philosophy and Social Theory
In addition to my professional and academic experience in machine learning, I also have an MA in Philosophy. You can find me attending philosophy talks around London and have written on topics such as [responsible AI](https://www.whattodoaboutnow.com/post/responsible-ai-responsible-to-whom) and African philosophy (more in the works!). My interest areas are primarily political, social, and ethical philosophy.
