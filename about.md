Currently, I am working as a machine learning engineer at Ocado Technology in the 10x team. I'm fascinated by machine learning and a strong believer in data-driven solutions. Previously, I completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge and studied electrical engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. I spent some time at Peralex Electronics where I worked as a Software Development Engineer. I'm particularly interested in the fields of NLP and Speech Processing.
