I am a machine learning engineer with research interests in Graph Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The process of coming up with novel solutions to difficult modelling problems and selecting the appropriate evaluation criteria in messy real-world contexts is a passion of mine. Some of my favourite tools include Python, PyTorch, NLTK, Docker, and Julia.

Currently, I work as a machine learning engineer at Ocado Technology where my responsibilities span the research, implementation, and early-stage productionisation of machine learning models. I completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge and studied electrical engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. In between these two academic pursuits, I worked at Peralex Electronics as a Software Engineer looking into whether deep learning techniques can be used to replace and improve traditional signal detection systems.

In my downtime, I enjoy listening to podcasts (give [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/) a listen) and learning to bake. If you want to find out more about my professional skills, take a look at my [Github profile](https://github.com/alecokas) and my [resume](/PDFs/resume/A-Kastanos-CV.pdf).
